            <p style="margin: 5px; padding: 5px;">Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ DL (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930)
                was a British writer and physician.
                He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and
                fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes stories are milestones in the
                field of crime fiction.

                Doyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction
                stories about Professor Challenger, and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard,
                as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short
                stories, "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste.
